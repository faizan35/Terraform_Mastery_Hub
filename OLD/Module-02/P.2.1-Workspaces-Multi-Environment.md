**Exercise: Terraform Workspaces with Local Provisioner**

**Task:**

1.  **Create a Terraform Configuration:**

    - Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
    - Inside the directory, create a file named `main.tf`.
    - Define a local provisioner that creates a local text file with a message.
    - Declare a variable `environment` with a default value of "dev."

2.  **Initialize and Apply for Default Workspace:**

    - Initialize Terraform using the `terraform init` command.
    - Apply the configuration using the `terraform apply` command.
    - Observe the generated files and directory structure, including the local file created by the provisioner.

3.  **Create a New Workspace:**

    - Create a new workspace named "prod" using the command `terraform workspace new prod`.
    - Switch to the "prod" workspace with `terraform workspace select prod`.

4.  **Adjust Configuration for the "prod" Workspace:**

    - Modify the `main.tf` file to include changes specific to the "prod" environment. For instance, update the local provisioner message or add new provisioners.

5.  **Apply Changes for the "prod" Workspace:**

    - Apply the changes using `terraform apply`.
    - Observe how Terraform generates a separate local file for the "prod" workspace.

6.  **Switch Between Workspaces:**

    - Switch back to the "dev" workspace using `terraform workspace select dev`.
    - Make a minor change in the `main.tf` file (e.g., update the local provisioner message).
    - Apply the changes using `terraform apply`.
    - Observe that changes in one workspace do not affect the other.

**Showcasing the Usefulness of Workspaces:**

Explain how workspaces are useful in managing different environments:

1.  **Isolation:** Each workspace maintains its own state, preventing interference between environments.
2.  **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Workspaces enable you to customize configurations for different environments, making it easy to handle variations.
3.  **Efficiency:** Manage multiple environments efficiently with a single set of configuration files.
4.  **Switching Workflow:** Switching between workspaces simplifies workflows for deploying and testing changes in different contexts.

**Note:** This exercise uses a local provisioner to keep it platform-independent and avoids cloud-specific complexities. You can replace the provisioner with any non-cloud-specific resource or provisioner based on your preferences.
