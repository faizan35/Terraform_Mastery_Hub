# Terraform Workspaces

## what is Terraform Workspaces.?

Terraform Workspaces help you organize isolated environments, like development and production, in a single configuration directory. This keeps their details separate while still using the same basic setup for everything.

- **Terraform Workspaces Overview:**

  - **Functionality:** Manage multiple environments or configurations within a single Terraform directory.
  - **Purpose:** Separate instances of the same configuration for different environments.
  - **Use Case:** Maintain different states for distinct environments while sharing the same infrastructure code.

- **Key Features:**

  - **Isolation:** Workspaces provide isolation for Terraform configurations.
  - **Shared Code:** Infrastructure code remains the same across all workspaces.
  - **Environment Management:** Easily switch between environments using workspaces.

- **Benefits:**

  - **Efficiency:** Avoid duplication of infrastructure code for each environment.
  - **Consistency:** Ensures consistent configuration across different environments.
  - **State Separation:** Each workspace has its own state file, preventing interference.

- **Usage:**

  - `terraform workspace new <name>`: Create a new workspace.
  - `terraform workspace select <name>`: Switch between existing workspaces.
  - `terraform workspace list`: View available workspaces.
  - `terraform workspace show`: Display the current workspace.

- **Considerations:**

  - Workspaces are local to the Terraform configuration directory.
  - Each workspace maintains its own variables and state.

- **Use Cases:**

  - Development, testing, production environments.
  - Multiple instances with varying configurations.

- **Best Practices:**

  - Name workspaces meaningfully (e.g., `dev`, `stage`, `prod`).
  - Understand and manage workspace-specific variables carefully.
