# Initializing a Terraform Configuration `terraform init`

The `terraform init` performs several key functions:

1.  **Plugin Installation:**

    - Downloads and installs the necessary provider plugins specified in the configuration.
    - Ensures plugin versions match the configuration.

2.  **Backend Initialization:**

    - Initializes the backend specified in the configuration (if any).
    - The backend is responsible for storing the **Terraform state**.

3.  **Initialization Process:**

    - Reads configuration files and sets up components.
    - Checks for existing state and downloads the provider plugins.

#### Example

```hcl
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "google" {
  credentials = file("path/to/google_credentials.json")
  project     = "your-google-project-id"
}
```

- In the example, Terraform is instructed to use the AWS and Google Cloud providers.
- `terraform init` will download and install the required plugins for these providers.
