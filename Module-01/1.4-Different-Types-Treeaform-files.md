# 1.4 Different Types of Terraform files

## Different Extentions

| File Type         | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.tf`             | Terraform configuration files written in HCL, defining infrastructure.                          |
| `.tfvars`         | Terraform variable files assigning values to variables in `.tf` files.                          |
| `.auto.tfvars`    | Automatically loaded variable files, similar to `.tfvars`.                                      |
| `.tfstate`        | Terraform state files storing the current state of provisioned infrastructure.                  |
| `.tfstate.backup` | Backup copies of `.tfstate` files created before making changes.                                |
| `.tfstate.lock`   | Lock files preventing concurrent modifications to the state file.                               |
| `.tfignore`       | Specify patterns to ignore files or directories during Terraform operations.                    |
| `.tpl` or `.tmpl` | Template files for generating dynamic content or placeholders.                                  |
| `.override.tf`    | Files containing override configurations to modify or extend existing Terraform configurations. |

- **`.tfstate.lock` files**: These are lock files used to prevent concurrent modifications to the state file by multiple Terraform operations. When Terraform is running, it locks the state file to prevent other operations from modifying it simultaneously. Once the operation is complete, Terraform releases the lock.

## Different Files

| File/Directory                   | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.tf`                        | The main Terraform configuration file where resources, providers, variables, and outputs are defined. |
| `variables.tf`                   | File specifically for declaring input variables used in the configuration.                            |
| `outputs.tf`                     | File specifically for declaring output values generated by the configuration.                         |
| `terraform.tfvars`               | File for assigning specific values to variables. It's one way to provide variable values.             |
| `.terraform`                     | Directory containing Terraform's internal files, including plugins, state files, and cache.           |
| `terraform.tfstate`              | The state file storing the current state of managed infrastructure.                                   |
| `terraform.tfstate.backup`       | Backup of the state file created before modifications.                                                |
| `terraform.tfstate.lock`         | Lock file used to prevent concurrent modifications to the state file.                                 |
| `.tfignore`                      | File specifying patterns of files or directories to be ignored during Terraform operations.           |
| `.terraformrc` or `terraform.rc` | Configuration file for customizing Terraform behavior and settings.                                   |

## About `main.tf`

The `main.tf` file in a Terraform project typically includes:

1.  **Resource Declarations**: Defines infrastructure resources to manage.
2.  **Provider Configuration**: Specifies the provider(s) and their settings.
3.  **Variable Declarations**: Defines input variables for the configuration.
4.  **Output Definitions**: Specifies values to display after applying the configuration.
5.  **Data Sources**: Fetches information from existing infrastructure or external services.
6.  **Provisioners (Optional)**: Defines actions to be taken on resources after creation/destruction.

> We can also use them in different files. eg., terraform.tf, data.tf, providers.tf, etc.

## These files are not pushed in github repo

1.  `./.terraform/*`: Excludes all files and directories within the `.terraform` directory from version control, which contains temporary files and cached data used by Terraform during operations.
2.  `./.terraform.lock.hcl`: Lock file storing dependency information for Terraform modules to ensure consistency across executions, generated by `terraform init`.
3.  `./terraform.tfstate`: Main Terraform state file storing the current state of managed infrastructure, containing sensitive information, and used for planning and applying changes.
4.  `./terraform.tfstate.backup`: Backup of the main Terraform state file, created automatically to provide redundancy and protection against corruption, and should not be committed to version control.
