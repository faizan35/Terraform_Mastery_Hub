# Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

- IaC is a way to manage and provision computing infrastructure through code (machine-readable script).

## Why do we need Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

1.  **Consistency:** Keeps your computer setup the same every time.
2.  **Efficiency:** Gets things done faster with automated setups.
3.  **Scalability:** Easily grows your computer power as needed.
4.  **Version Control:** Tracks changes and lets you go back to previous setups.
5.  **Reproducibility:** Can recreate your computer setup reliably.
6.  **Collaboration:** Makes it easy for a bunch of people to work together.
7.  **Traceability:** Keeps a detailed record of all changes made.
8.  **Reduced Human Errors:** Less chance of making mistakes with automated setups.
9.  **Flexibility:** Lets you quickly adjust to new needs or changes.
10. **Cost Savings:** Helps manage and optimize costs effectively.

## What is terraform?

- Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
- It was open source but not now.
- Terraform uses a declarative configuration language to describe the desired state of your infrastructure.

## **Advantages of Using Terraform for IaC:**

1.  **Declarative Syntax:** Describes what you want without getting into the nitty-gritty details.
2.  **Multi-Cloud Support:** Works smoothly with different cloud providers, giving you options.
3.  **Resource Graph:** Plans and deploys resources in the right order, preventing issues.
4.  **State Management:** Keeps track of your current setup, preventing conflicts during changes.
5.  **Community and Ecosystem:** Taps into a helpful community and pre-built modules, saving time and ensuring best practices.
