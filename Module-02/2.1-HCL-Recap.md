# HCL Recap

### **Brief Overview for those who already know HCL syntax:**

For those familiar with HCL syntax, let's briefly review key elements.

1.  **Variables:**

    Variables allow you to parameterize your Terraform configurations. They are defined using the `variable` block and can have default values:

    ```hcl
    variable "region" {
    default = "us-east-1"
    }
    ```

2.  **Resources:**

    Resources are the building blocks of your infrastructure. They represent the desired state of a specific object in the cloud (e.g., EC2 instance, S3 bucket). Example:

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
    ami           = "ami-12345678"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    }
    ```

3.  **Data Blocks:**

    Data blocks allow you to retrieve information from resources or external sources. Example:

    ```hcl
    data "aws_ami" "latest_amazon_linux" {
    most_recent = true
    owners      = ["amazon"]

    filter {
        name   = "name"
        values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
    }
    }
    ```

4.  **Output Blocks:**

    Output blocks define values that are informative for the user and can be displayed after applying the configuration. Example:

    ```hcl
    output "instance_ip" {
    value = aws_instance.example_instance.public_ip
    }
    ```

5.  **Expressions:**

    Expressions in Terraform allow you to create dynamic configurations. Example:

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
    ami           = "ami-12345678"
    instance_type = var.instance_type == "small" ? "t2.micro" : "t2.large"
    }
    ```

#### **Advanced HCL Features:**

Now, let's explore some advanced features of HCL.

1.  **Functions:**

    HCL includes several built-in functions that enable more sophisticated configurations. Example:

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
    ami           = "ami-12345678"
    instance_type = upper(var.instance_type)
    }
    ```

2.  **Modules:**

    Modules in Terraform allow you to encapsulate and reuse configurations. They are defined in separate directories and can be called multiple times. Example:

    ```hcl
    # module definition in module/ec2/main.tf
    module "example_instance" {
    source = "./module/ec2"
    ami    = "ami-12345678"
    }
    ```

3.  **Dynamic Blocks:**

    Dynamic blocks enable you to create multiple similar nested blocks dynamically. Example:

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "example_instances" {
    count = 5

    dynamic "ebs_block" {
        for_each = var.ebs_volumes

        content {
        device_name = ebs_block.key
        volume_type = ebs_block.value
        }
    }
    }
    ```
